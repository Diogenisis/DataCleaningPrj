run_analysis.R 
==============

This program takes the folder structure "UCI HAR Dataset" as created by unzipping "UCI HAR Dataset.zip”,
a data set used for “Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones” downloaded from 

       "https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip"

and creates a “tidy” dataset of the averages of the standard deviations and means per subject, activity, and measure and writes it to “X_tidy_Avg_of_Means_and_Stds.csv”.

For more structure and background of the orginal data sets please see the documentation contained in 
	"https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip"
and also 
	“http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones”


The program performs the following analysis steps:
--------------------------------------------------

A) As the original data set is used for machine learning it is divided into a training and a test data set
we first combine these data sets into one each for observations (X), subjects, and activity labels/ordinals (y)

B) We then use the mapping of activity ordinal to a descriptive text describing the activity as contained 
   in "activity_labels.txt" to replace the activity label listed in y by the activity name.

C) We then read in the table “features.txt” mapping the feature (measure) number to descriptive names.
   This table has one row for each column in the X data set, the row number in “features.txt” corresponding
   to the column number in X

D) We extract the "relevant" features, i.e. the means and standard deviations assuming that this means
any feature containing either "mean()" or "std()" anywhere in the feature name resulting in 66 features;
and we replace "funny" characters which might cause issues when used in a programming context:
  1. "(" and ")" are deleted 
  2. "-" and "," are replace by "_" 


E) We now set the labels of the corresponding columns to their modified feature names
   and keep only the columns with the relevant features

F) Now we add columns for subject and activity (vector y) to the left of table X
   and label them “Subject” and “Activity”, creating a tidy albeit wide data set 
   which we save to "X_tidy_Means_and_Stds.csv" just incase...

G) Now we melt X into a skinny data set by making the relevant feature (measure) type into a variable 

H) Finally use sqldf to calculate the average of each relevant feature per activity per subject
   and write the result to "X_tidy_Avg_of_Means_and_Stds.csv" in the current working directory
